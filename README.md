# GitHubWordCounting
A script that counts the words from 1M Java code, 1M Ruby code, 1M C++ code, merges the results and outputs a JSON file for every language.

You can run the script with the test data as follows:

```ruby -I src/ main.rb <folder>```

If you want to download all repositories, just tun download_repos.sh as follows:

```bash download_repos.sh```
